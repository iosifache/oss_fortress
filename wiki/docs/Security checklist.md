One-time activities are marked with 驕놾잺, and the recurrent ones with 游대.

:::

## I. Proactive vulnerability discovery

驕놾잺 Create a threat model. <br/>
驕놾잺 Choose a suite of security tools to scan your codebase. <br/>
驕놾잺 Automate the suite of security tools in local/development environments and CI/CD pipelines, with quality gates. <br/>
驕놾잺 Request the integration of your project with OSS-Fuzz. <br/>
游대 Periodically check for vulnerabilities in your dependencies. <br/>
游대 Constantly validate the warnings from your security tooling. <br/>
游대 Keep the threat model updated.

## II. Secure users

驕놾잺 Design your software to be secure by default. <br/>
驕놾잺 Have security recommendations for users. <br/>
驕놾잺 Create SBOMs.

## III. Established security reporting process

驕놾잺 Have a standardised, documented process for responding to vulnerabilities. <br/>
驕놾잺 Create a security policy with preferred way to contact and report format. <br/>
驕놾잺 Find backup security responders. <br/>
游대 Be transparent and verbose with the reported vulnerabilities: mention patching commits, attach security tags to issues, and request CVE IDs.
