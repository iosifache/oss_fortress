## Context

Regardless of where it is hosted, a codebase could end up in the hands of malicious actors. Aside from the open source scenario, attackers may utilize sophisticated techniques to access and download it. Okta's 2022 breach, in which the source code of the identity and access management platform was obtained from GitHub, is an example.

With this in mind, developers are advised to take a defensive posture, namely to uncover as many flaws in their code as possible before releasing it to the public.

## The workshop

The workshop, named The Open Source Fortress, provides both theoretical and practical information about **detecting vulnerabilities in codebases**. It explains how each technique works, what open source tools are available, and then provides real examples. If you plan to do the workshop alone, the first two explanations should be replaced with recommended talks from each Basics section.

The examples imply the discovery of vulnerabilities in a custom, purposefully vulnerable codebase named **Ubuntu Portrait**. It is written in C and Python.

The **included techniques** are:
- Threat modelling;
- Secret scanning;
- Dependency scanning;
- Linting;
- Code querying;
- Symbolic execution; and
- Fuzzing.
